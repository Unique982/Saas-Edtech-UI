# 🚀 SaaS Platform Frontend

This is the frontend repository for our modern SaaS (Software as a Service) application. It is built using **Next.js** with **TypeScript** and **TailwindCSS**. This frontend interfaces with the backend API to handle user interaction, dashboards, and client-side logic for different roles like Admin, Institute, Teacher, and Student.

##  Project Repositories
The SaaS frontend is split into multiple repositories for better modularity and role-based separation:
- ### [Institute Frontend Repository](https://github.com/Unique982/Saas-Edtech-Ui-Clinet-Institute.git)  
  Contains UI and features specific to the Institute role, including institute dashboards, course management, and other institute-related interfaces.
  
- ### [Teacher Frontend Repository](https://github.com/Unique982/Saas-EdTech-Ui-Clinet-Teacher.git)  
  Dedicated repository for teacher-related UI, including lesson planning, student evaluations, and teacher dashboards.

- ### [Student Frontend Repository](https://github.com/Unique982/Saas-Edtech-Student)  
  Handles student-facing UI such as course enrollment, progress tracking, and student dashboards.

You can find and contribute to each role-based repository individually.
